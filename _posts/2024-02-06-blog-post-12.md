# Tasks Completed 
- Worked on project over J-term
- Read papers on contrastive learning
- Implemented cVAE
- Implemented cPCA (interesting avenue for multiple classification if posterior collapse is fixed)
- Got really frustrated with posterior collapse
- Though about why are we using autoencoders vs variational autoencoders (posterior collapse avoided)
- Found three more articles to read
  - Synthesizing Multi-Modal Minority Samples for Tabular Data (they sample in the latent space, they stoole our idea!)
  - New Oversampling Approaches Based on Polynomial Fitting for Imbalanced Data Sets (2008) (interesting interpolations)
  - On the Quality of Synthetic Generated Tabular Data (interesting article that I'm gonna read)
