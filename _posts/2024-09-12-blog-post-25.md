# Tasks Completed 
- Attended Fall Senior Workshop
  - Gained information on Presentations of progress
  - Need thesis reader by Sept. 19 - **will talk about in meeting**
- Began developing code base for VAE training methods
  - Comparing loss curves for sampling methods across datasets

# Comparing Training Methods
- Comparing four sampling methods (*none, undersampling, oversampling, smote*) for training a VAE across four different imbalanced datasets (*"ecoli", "us_crime", "spectrometer", "scene"*)
- Currently looking at the loss curves of the training data for each sampling method
  - Results show that undersampling is worst (*makes sense, so its a good thing we investigated this*), where oversampling and smote show improvements compared to no sampling
  - *This is seen across all four datasets - almost identical looking curves are seen*.
- future investigation will lead to us:
  - increasing the number of datasets to investigate
  - Looking at reconstruction for minority vs majority groups
  - Looking at the latent representations for minority vs majority groups (how can we quantitativley show this)
  - Seperating training vs testing groups (code right now does not enable this - **it will next week**)

# Calendar

| Week | Days    | Content    | 
| :---:   | :---: | :---: |
| Week 0 | August 30 - September 5 | Began reviewing where we left off; made plan for future and registered for 4998 hours. |
| Week Two | September 6 - September 12 | Finish developing code base for first task (training strategy), and begin experimenting with training methods. |
| Week Three | September 13 - September 19 | Finalize experiments, analyze data (make changes to architecture as needed). **Find thesis reader** |
| Week Four | September 20 - September 26 | Write abstract for CCSE - make plans for second step (Sampling in latent space).  |
| Week Five | September 27 - October 3 | Write first part of thesis (training model) and begin work for presentations of progress. |


<a name="questions"></a>
# Questions Raised
- Who should be the second thesis reader?
- How in depth shoould the training of VAE's go?

<a name="moving"></a>
# Moving Forward
## Short-Term Goals
- Continue to investigate sampling methods to train VAE's
  - Follow the next steps outlined above
- Find thesis reader

## Long-Term Goals
- Stay in accordance with the calendar
- Prepare for presentations of progress
