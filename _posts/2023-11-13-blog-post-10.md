# Tasks Completed 
- Implemented Wilson's edit nearest neighbor and ensemble filter
- Made code good/reproduceable

# Noise
These methods attempt to remove uneccessary noise from the synthetic examples.

## Wilson's ENN
Looking at k = 3, if a majority of the nearest neghbors are majority, remove the example. 

## Filter Ensemble
Use a k-fold crossover. If an example is voted to be majority, remove it!

## Results
Not too much. Increased f1, but not as much as leaving the nosie in.

# Making the Code Good
The bulk of this week was spent putting everything into functions. When I was putting things into functions, I noticed a small error with the standard deviation that, when fixed, made our results better.
