# Tasks Completed 

- Read a paper using variational autoencoders to generate minority examples in crash data
- Based on this paper, I attempted to create similar visuals and methods in another dataset (Indian Diabetes)
- Began working on the application for NCUR

# Crash Paper
- Read [this](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000145752031770X?ref=pdf_download&fr=RR-2&rr=81ab2e38edea424f) paper titled "Crash Data Augmentation using Variational Autoencoders."
- This paper focused on the use of VAE's as a data augmentation technique to produce crash data (500 vs. 5 million observations imbalanced data)
- Compared to SMOTE, a GAN, and ADASYN
- Used some 80% confident ellipsoid method (**not sure what this meant, but looked cool**)
- This paper explained the reason behind oversampling and VAE's very well.
- Interesting graphs to compare synthetic and real data
  - Box and whiskers to compare the mean and standard deviation across real/synthetic and ALL (or most) columns
  - Used violin plots to visualize the data distributions across columns (**I really enjoyed this**)
  - Displayed, using a table, the mean, max, min, std, and results from three stats test (t-test, levene test, ks-test)
- Compared the results using a confusion matrix of LR, ANN, and SVM
- Reported specificity and sensitivity
