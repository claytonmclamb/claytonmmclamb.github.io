# Tasks Completed 
- Worked on Gaussian Mixture VAE's
- Implemented an Adversarial Approach for the VaDE model.
- Made more GIFS. 

# Adversarial Variational Deep Embedding (AVaDE)
- VaDE is a glorified GMVAE, but was better written
- Using a single, dense, layer to predict what class observations belong to, an adversary could encourage clusters to be more homogenous and complete (*EVaDE*)
- after our conversation yeesterday, I realize I implemented the adversary wrong (was not optimizing/training the adversary at the same time).
