# Tasks Completed 
- Read about VAEs from that really good fellow, Goodfellow
- Asked ChatGPT to make a VAE for tabular data
  - The ChatGPT VAE worked, but did not reconstruct very well across classes
- Fixed the reconstruction using methods from previous VAE's
- Outlined next steps


# VAE made by Chat GPT
I asked chat GPT to make a variational autoencoder. 

After making slight edits for it to work and train, I got a working VAE that does not have the strange posterior collapse/vector problem.

The issue with this VAE is that it did not reconstruct across classes very well. It would kind of place data in the middle/around the mean of all the classes. 

# Fixing the Class Reconstruction Issue

From previous VAE's I learned that sending the classes in as seperate batches worked particularly well for each class.
