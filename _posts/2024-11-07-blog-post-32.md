# Tasks Completed 
- Presented my research at CCSC:SE
- Programming competition at CCSC:SE (not really related)
- Investigated Discrete Data Generation

# CCSC:SE
Over the weekend, we drove down to Greenville, SC and participated in CCSC:SE. Here are my takeaways. 

- People love **RAG**, a business majors solution to a computer science problem.
- People struggle to understand the idea behind dimensionality reduction, fairness, and what a standard dataset is.

When I write the thesis and do more presentations, this will be taken into account. I won't make it easier, but instead I'm just going to throw formulas up and call it trivial. Then you can't disagree with me.

# Discrete Data Generation
Over the past day, I investigated Discrete data generation in our VAE. I noticed something I'll show in our meeting. **The VAE must be very undercomplete.**
