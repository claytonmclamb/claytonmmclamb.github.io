# Tasks Completed 

- Began (and still) working on the software engineering for the cVAE file. Making sure it is as nice as possible will help me later when runnning experiments.
- Read (and mostly implemented) KNNOR (KNN-OveRsampling)
  - Mainly used on images.
  - Authors mentioned how it could be used in a latent space.
  - Applied it ot the latent space of a basic var-autoencoder.
  - Interesting to explore.
- Researching methods on how to manipulate the latent space better to seperte classes. 
- Want to explore the following article more in depth
  - New Oversampling Approaches Based on Polynomial Fitting for Imbalanced Data Sets (2008) (interesting interpolations)

# Moving Forward

## Short-Term Goals
- Make a timeline. Iron out the details.
- Finish putting together the cVAE file.
- Implement KNN-OR fully. 


## Long-Term Goals
- Get results within the next 2-3 weeks and make a SURF abstract.
