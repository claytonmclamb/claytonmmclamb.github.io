# Tasks Completed 
- Got accepted to the Student Research Conference at CCSC:SE
- Finalized sampling code
- Begun working on presentations of progress

# CCSC Student Research Contest

These are the steps in the student research contest:
- Register under the student rate by October 18th (**done**)
- Poster presentation (*November 1*)
- If selected as one of five finalists, I am selected to deliver a full 15 minute presentation during session II.

# Sampling

Over fall break, I finished the code to begin sampling with the sVAE. 

When compared to SURF data - I notice no significant difference. 

I have some cool visuals to show in the meeting - as well as some thoughts. 


# Presentations of Progress
Next Friday, I have to give my presentation of progress. Workshopping my SURF presentation with new details for this (*will go over in meeting*).
