# Tasks Completed 
- Worked on Gaussian Mixture VAE's
- Implemented the Variational Deep Embedding (VaDE) model and gained a beter understand (*Some things are still black magic*)

# Variational Deep Embedding (VaDE)
- VaDE is a glorified GMVAE, but was better written
- Using a Github posted, I was able to implement VaDE
- Seperates majority/minority classes well, but could be better
- Reconstruction kind of funky, could be better (but also I have a theory that could work to our advantage)
- Sampling from Gaussian Mixtures not working after training the model (*may have done something wrong*)
- Made a GIF to visualize the training of the model.
