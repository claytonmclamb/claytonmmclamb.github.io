# Tasks Completed 
- Gathered my thoughts on training with Cross Entropy and Discrete Values
- Began wiriting and drafting thesis

# My Final Thoughts and Takeaways from Cross Entropy and VAE's
I was able to develop a model for the Adult Dataset, which contains a mix of continous and discrete values. When using the previous discussed model (uses Cross Entropy for discrete columns and MSE for continous columns), the VAE generated the most average example. While I considered using Sparse CE, that didn't feel like a propoer fix to the problem (_we focus on imbalance learning and use a deep learning fix to generate data felt like nonsense in my head_). 

# The Thesis Draft
So far, I have outlined and planned most of the introduction to the thesis. _I even wrote the first introduction_. However, after planning the section focusing on oversampling/undersampling algorithms, I plan to talk about DG models, which ones should I talk about?
