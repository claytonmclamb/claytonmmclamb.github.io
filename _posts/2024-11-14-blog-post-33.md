# Tasks Completed 
- Worked on what I'm calling the CD-VAE (my first two initials and stands for Continous + Discrete)

# CD-VAE
This thing is a pain to train. Using Gumbell softmax, CE, MSE, this thing is a hyperparameter mess. However, sometimes it looks very good. We need some good datasets to use and investigate. Will talk about this in meeting.
