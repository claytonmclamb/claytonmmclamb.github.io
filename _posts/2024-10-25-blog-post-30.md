# Tasks Completed 
- Got results
- Made presentation for Presentations of Progress
- Started making a Multimodel VAE

# Results
This past weekend, I was able to get results (accuracy, precision, f1, recall) across five datasets and two classifiers. Overall, our method looks promising (sent the csv files over and have made graphs)

# Presentations of Progress
Made my presentations of progress.
I needed: title page, background, method, results, recap, any problems.

Will go over this in meeting. 

# Multimodal VAE
Came up with the idea to treat discrete columns as one-hot encoded sequence of nodes in a neural net. Going to show architecture in meeting.
