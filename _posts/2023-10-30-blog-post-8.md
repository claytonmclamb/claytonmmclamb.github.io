<a name="questions"></a>
# Questions Raised
- When I linearly interpolated from the minority class and ran it through the decoder of the TVAE, I was given observations in the minority class. Why did this happen? I assume it is due to randomness.
- Now that I am applying to NCUR, should I amp up the technical language?

# Moving Forward

## Short-Term Goals
- Read papers on Linear Interpolation within the next week
- As I read papers on Linear Interpolation, report the metrics and visuals


## Long-Term Goals
- Apply to NCUR
- Stay on the timeline.
