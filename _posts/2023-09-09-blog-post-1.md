# Moving Forward

## Short-Term Goals
- Have at least ten sources read & annotated by next week (9/18)
  - *currently have six sources*
  - Read another on tabular data generation (preferabbly CTGAN/TVAE)
  - Read another on active learning for tabular-based problems (lots for computer-vision, text, not for tabular data)
  - Read one on the advantages and disadvantages of generative modeling
- Try and make some basic visuals to make these topics digestible (*can be used for proposal*)

## Long-Term Goals
- Have the narrative and proposal *done* by the rough draft deadline on 9/28
  - This includes an abstract, introduction, literature review, main goal, methods, final product, annotated bib, budget, timeline
  - Gives until 10/18 to implement recomennded changes, finalize the timeline and  budget, get signatures, etc.
  - **this goal has not changed from last week**
