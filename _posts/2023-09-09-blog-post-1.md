This is the second blog post for my research project. If you're looking for the first, it was done in RMarkdown and won't be here...yet.

## $\mathcal{\color{purple}{Tabular \ and \ Latent \ Space \ Synthetic \ Data \ Generation: \ a \ Literature \ Review}}$
[*Link*](https://journalofbigdata.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40537-023-00792-7#:~:text=This%20literature%20review%20focuses%20on%20generation%20mechanisms%20applied,data%20and%20latent%20space%20may%20be%20used%20interchangeably.)

Synthetic data, acquired through generative processes that attempt to mimic real data, is studied infrequently for tabular data when compared to images or text. In an attempt to provide a literature review for tabular synthetic data, Fonseca and Bacao review over 70 generation algorithms to focus on the core generative process of synthetic tabular data. Proposing a taxonomy for synthetic data generation, consisting of the architecture, application level, data space, and scope, Fonseca and Bacao are able to assess the success of different levels across different applications. When generating data, the context of the application determines how the data will be generated. For example, when focusing on the anonymization of data, a model based on differential privacy would be employed. In addition to privacy, regularization, oversampling, active learning, semi-supervised learning, and self-supervised learning are all applications reviewed. Concluding with a review of generation mechanisms, such as linear or geometric transformations, and novel evalutaion metrics, the authors were able to provide a unique and comprehensive survey for tabular synthetic data generation. This research will rely on the implementation of synthetic data generation models, such as CTGAN or TVAE, and this literature review provided invaluable insight into and organization for generative algorithms.

# Moving Forward

## Short-Term Goals
- Have at least ten sources read & annotated by next week (9/18)
  - *currently have six sources*
  - Read another on tabular data generation (preferabbly CTGAN/TVAE)
  - Read another on active learning for tabular-based problems (lots for computer-vision, text, not for tabular data)
  - Read one on the advantages and disadvantages of generative modeling
- Try and make some basic visuals to make these topics digestible (*can be used for proposal*)

## Long-Term Goals
- Have the narrative and proposal *done* by the rough draft deadline on 9/28
  - This includes an abstract, introduction, literature review, main goal, methods, final product, annotated bib, budget, timeline
  - Gives until 10/18 to implement recomennded changes, finalize the timeline and  budget, get signatures, etc.
  - **this goal has not changed from last week**
